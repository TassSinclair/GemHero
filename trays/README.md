Cups and Trays
--------------
A cup can hold a single gem. Individual cups have a fixed border around them, to space them out against adjacent cups.

A tray is made up of multiple cups. The border of each tray is inset (via a "Shrink/Fatten" operation) by 0.02 Blender units to allow multiple 3D-printed trays to sit next to each other.


A full Gem Hero game is made up of:

* 1x center tray (24 cups)
* 6x slice tray (36 cups)
* 6x corner tray (37 cups) (4, 5 or 6 players only)
